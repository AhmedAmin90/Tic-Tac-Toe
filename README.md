# Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project I created a Tic Tac Toe game using Ruby.

# Built with:
* Ruby.
* Rainbow gem


# Game Rules: 

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. One of the player is X and the second player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in the squares.

3. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

# The game instructions:

These are the game instructions:
1. The board contains 9 boxes each box has its nubmer from 1 to 9.
2. The player one will have X sign.
3. The player two will have O sign.
4. Each player has to select a number on the board between 1 and 9. The number automatically will change to the sign of the player (X or O).
5. If the player select a number outside the range or a position is already taken, the game will show that the player need to select another number.
6. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
7. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has success condition, the game ends in a draw.
