# Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project I created a Tic Tac Toe game using Ruby.

# Built with:
*  Ruby.


# Game Rules: 

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. One of the player is X and the second player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in the squares.

3. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.



# Setup:

1. To run this project locally, please ensure you have Ruby installed on your machine, then clone this repository by running.

2. After cloning open the file and go to bin directory then open the terminal and write in terminal :

3. Maximize your terminal window for a better experience. 

4. Enjoy the game!
